#MIXER

##What problem are we trying to solve:
Itâ€™s tough to socialize at a crowded bar. Getting your drinks can be a nightmare, and it disrupts your focus on socializing.. Having an open tab can get costly for patrons as they focus on socializing and present risks of payment problems to bars. 


##Solution: 
Smartphone app allows patrons to take a selfie - How I Look Tonight and use that as their profile image for the evening. They can use the app to browse other people in the bar and figure out quickly and easily if someone else is receptive to conversation, drinks, or romance. 
No messaging - app includes the ability to wink/nudge/wave/smile and respond as receptive/unreceptive, but immediately forces human interaction rather than messaging back and forth.

The app allows users to directly browse the bar menu and place their orders electronically without having to yell out an easily-confused order in a noisy bar. Orders are paid upfront.
